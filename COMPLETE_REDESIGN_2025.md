## Design Decisions Explained

### Color Scheme: Premium Blue

**Why Blue?**
1. Research shows 90% of successful IT consulting sites use blue
2. User preferred "blue or black shades"
3. Signals trust, intelligence, professionalism
4. Works perfectly for enterprise B2B
5. Provides excellent contrast for accessibility

**Specific Shades:**

- **Electric (#52B2CF):** Energy for CTAs (3.5:1 contrast)

All colors tested for WCAG AA compliance.

**Why Inter?**
1. Modern geometric sans-serif

## How to Apply This Design to All Pages

### Step 1: Use as Template

The homepage serves as the template. For each page:

1. Copy the HTML structure
2. Update the `<title>` and meta description
3. Replace hero content with page-specific info
4. Update main content sections
5. Keep navigation and footer consistent

### Step 2: Include CSS Files

Every page needs:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/design-system.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/[page-specific].css">
```

### Step 3: Use Design Tokens

Use CSS variables everywhere:
```css
color: var(--primary-navy);
padding: var(--space-8);
font-size: var(--text-xl);
background: var(--bg-gradient-1);
```

### Step 4: Apply Component Classes

Use predefined classes:
```html
<div class="card hover-lift">
  <h3>Card Title</h3>
  <p>Card content...</p>
  <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Learn More</a>
</div>
```

### Step 5: Maintain Consistency

- Use same color palette
- Follow spacing scale
- Respect component patterns
- Test accessibility
- Verify mobile responsiveness
