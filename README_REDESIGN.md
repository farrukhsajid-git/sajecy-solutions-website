## How to Apply to Other Pages

### Step 1: Copy Template

Use `index.html` as your template for all pages.

### Step 2: Include CSS

Every page needs these two files:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/design-system.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/[page-name].css">
```

### Step 3: Use Components

Follow the patterns from the homepage:

**Button Example:**
```html
<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg hover-lift">
  Click Me
</a>
```

**Card Example:**
```html
<div class="card hover-lift">
  <h3>Card Title</h3>
  <p>Card content goes here...</p>
  <a href="#" class="btn btn-secondary">Learn More</a>
</div>
```

**Service Card Example:**
```html
<div class="service-card card">
  <div class="service-icon">
    <!-- SVG icon here -->
  </div>
  <h3 class="service-title">Service Name</h3>
  <p class="service-description">Description...</p>
  <ul class="service-features">
    <li>Feature one</li>
    <li>Feature two</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="#" class="service-link">Learn more →</a>
</div>
```

### Step 4: Use CSS Variables

Never hardcode values. Always use variables:
```css
color: var(--primary-navy);
padding: var(--space-8);
font-size: var(--text-xl);
background: var(--bg-gradient-1);
```

### Step 5: Test Everything

Before deploying any page:
- ✓ Test on mobile (resize browser)
- ✓ Check all links work
- ✓ Verify images load
- ✓ Test keyboard navigation
- ✓ Check color contrast
- ✓ Validate HTML
- ✓ Test in multiple browsers
